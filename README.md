# Work Day Scheduler

This is a handy website built to help the working person! Schedule your plans for your work day, and watch in real time as your work day proceeds and the colors change based on the time of the day. Save your tasks and they will persist even after leaving the website! 
 

AS A employee
I WANT a website that stores and keeps track of my work day tasks
SO THAT I can visualize my deadlines and make the most of my work day


A couple of roadblocks for me in this project was working with local storage and using Moment JS
